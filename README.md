<p style="text-align: center">Welcome to Programic's coding standards. Here we have described our coding guidelines, agreements, best practices and code quality tools.</p>

## ✅ Why use coding standards?
We created these standards so that we can write code that is consistent, readable, efficient, maintainable and secure. It improves the quality of the code and makes it accessible to every developer. In addition, it prevents common coding errors.

## 📈 Linting tools
When we combine these best practices with effective linting tools, it becomes easy for everyone to comply. See the `packages` folder for linting tools per language.

## 🤝 Usage agreements
It is not the intention that exceptions are made to the agreed standards. If a team wants this, it must first be discussed with the standards team. In addition, no exceptions to linting may be made, unless there is no other technical option. Preference is therefore no reason to make an exception to linting rules.

The standards are living documents. If anyone has an idea for an addition/change, this can be reported to someone in the standards team. This person will then throw this into the group to see what we can do with it. It is of course not the intention that the standards change every week, because then it is difficult for everyone to adhere to them.
